<p class="aboutUs">Covid-19 has created a monotonous routine for almost all of us and it's time we break out of it. Everyday, I wake up wondering what new I can do to have some fun and abandon the pattern of my day. stepOUT does exactly that. It takes your routine and interests as an input and in return, offers you a few activities per day which are out of your comfort zone and can also be refreshing. A sense of accomplishment and a refreshed enthusiasm is guaranteed!</p>
